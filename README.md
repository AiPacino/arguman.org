## Benefits

Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action. In its exemplary form, it is based on universal intellectual values that transcend subject matter divisions: clarity, accuracy, precision, consistency, relevance, sound evidence, good reasons, depth, breadth, and fairness.

Basis of critical thinking is arguments. Assesment is done over  argument, argument premises, promotives and corruptives.

You may think argument mappings as visual hierarchy mappings.

Arguman.org’s aim is arguments to be mapped successfully by many users.
